# Sppu Parser (Hacktoberfest 23)

## **Project Overview**

The project involves working with PDF files released by SPPU (Savitribai Phule Pune University) for each college per semester. These PDF files contain a variety of information related to students and their academic performance, including:

`student_name`, `student_prn`, `student_mother_name`, `subject_code`, `ise_score`,`ese_score`, `total_score`,`tw_score`,`pr_score`,`or_score`, `crd_score`, `grade`, `grade_point`, `credit_point`, `sgpa` , `total_credits` 

The project has two main objectives:

### **1. PDF Parsing**

Develop a Python program that can automatically parse the PDF files provided by SPPU to extract all the relevant data mentioned above.

### **2. Data Analysis and Visualization**

Create a data pipeline that processes the parsed data to derive insights and generate graphs or visualizations to facilitate a better understanding of the academic performance of students.

Visit the [Project Wiki](https://github.com/notcostheta/sppu-parser/wiki/Project-Setup) to setup your local environment and get started with the project.

## **Todo List**
- [ ] Make the project colab-notebook friendly
- [ ] Add a open in colab button
- [ ] Write the documentation for the logic that parses the PDF
- [ ] Prepare a data model for the data to be parsed
